The Online Judge Platform is a web-based application where users can solve coding problems, run or submit code in multiple programming languages, and get automated verdicts. It supports secure and isolated code execution using Docker containers, a role-based authentication system, and optional AI-enhanced features such as code review and alternative suggestions.
